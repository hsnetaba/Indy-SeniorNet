	<h3>Project Questions</h3>
	<p>
		Who is your audience and what are you trying to convey to them through your logo?<br>
		My audience consists of elderly individuals and their caretakers seeking education to learn how to effectively use computers. My logo was meant to be simple and easy to understand, containing the name of the organization/website, soft and pleasant colors, and a recognizable graphic of a computer.<br><br>
		What product did you use to get the final product to look like you want it?<br>
		I used Adobe CS6 through IUAnyware.<br><br>
		What difficulties did you have in using the software product? How did you overcome these difficulties? What resources did you use?<br>
		I had a bit of trouble getting the background how I wanted due to the low resolution of the computer image I used leaving an undesirable pixelated border. I finally settled on a slightly cream off-white to compliment the blue text. I used Google Drive for the font and text, and google images for the computer graphic.<br><br>
		Explain what worked well and what did not go well with this project. What new skills did you acquire with creating the logo and creating the website?<br>
		I messed around a bit with different shades of blue and grey/white for the computer, finally settling on one which was reminiscent of the late 80s/early 90s. I learned many different things about photo editing, and the most useful in my opinion was the ability to cleanly edit a single item out of an image away from itâ€™s background to be used in your graphic.<br><br>
